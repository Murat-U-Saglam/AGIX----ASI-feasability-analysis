EDA of price comparison of AGIX and FET token to provide visibility to the upcoming merger


## Custom Request 1

I just asked Mario during the live YouTube stream about the conversion rate.

His answer to my argument about the 12 month AGIX SMA being 0.78:1 conversion rate vs. the 15-day SMA being 0.43:1 ratio was:

Mario said, taking into consideration just AGIX's SMA of 12 months is not enough.
It has to be between all three companies.
He compared 15 days, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months across all three companies and came to the 0.43:1 for SingularityNET as the best average. 

Can you guys please run the numbers to see if this is correct? 

Thank you
